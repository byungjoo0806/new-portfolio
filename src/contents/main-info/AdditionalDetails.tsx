        With the growth of decentralized network, I was attracted by the blockchain technology that ensures both security and convenience. 
        However, even with the research on details of such technology, I could not fully grasp the concept and the structure. 
        Rather than being one of the readers of the information written by others, I wanted to be the one who could explain the whole details of blockchain technology.
        So I decided to learn how to become a blockchain developer; thanks to a bootcamp course, I was able to open up a new path to my future career.

        Other than blockchain, I also have high passion towards frontend development.
        The fact that I can see how a webpage changes as I write my code has shocked me in the beginning.
        The fact that I was actually changing the design of the webpage just by writing some codes was enough to mesmerize me.
        That feeling of achievement was something that I have never felt before; it was something much larger than the moment I was accepted to college or the moment I received an award at a soccer tournament.
        There are still a lot to learn and that's another reason that I really want to go for frontend developer.
        I think I will never stop learning; I think I will never stop improving.
        And I think I will make a huge impact in this area.
